# The Purpose of This Independent Project 
- To help my friend narrow down what dog breed to get.

### **Consider Your Lifestyle**      
- How active are you?  
- Do you have children?  
- Do you have the necessary funds?  
- Do you have the time to train them?  
- Are you home for long periods?  
- What will you do with the dog when your out of town?  

### **Consider Your Expectations**  
- Do you prefer large or small dogs?  
- How much time are you willing to spend grooming a dog? Do you have allergies?  
- Do you have a specific activity you want the dog to do with you?  
  

### **Breed Groups**   
1. Working - Bred for practical duties like watchdogs and sled dogs. They are intelligent and loyal.  
2. Herding - Bred to herd livestock and are smart and energetic.  
3. Hound - Bred for hunting. They are affectionate and strong- willed.  
4. Sporting - Bred to retrieve game. They have high energy levels.  
5. Non-Sporting - Dogs who don't fit into any other category.  
6. Toy - Bred to be companions.  
7. Terrier - Bred to kill vermin.   

### **Character Traits** 
1. Adaptability Level   
2. Affectionate With Family   
3. Barking Level   
4. Coat Grooming Frequency   
5. Drooling Level  
6. Energy Level   
7. Good With Other Dogs  
8. Good With Young Children  
9. Mental Stimulation Needs  
10. Openness To Strangers  
11. Playfulness Level  
12. Shedding Level  
13. Trainability Level  
14. Watchdog/Protective Nature
