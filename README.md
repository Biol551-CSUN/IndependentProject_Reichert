*Identifying The Best Dog Breed For an Individual Based on Their Preference and Lifestyle*

### Purpose of this Project
Talking to family members and friends I realized that many people don't know how to pick a dog breed that would best suit them. Instead they pick dogs based on their appearance or becuase they were told it was a good fit. I wanted to be able to show my friend who recently moved what dog would realistically work best for them.
